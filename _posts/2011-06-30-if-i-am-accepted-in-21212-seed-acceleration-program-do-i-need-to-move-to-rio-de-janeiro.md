Even though we believe that acceleration works much better when we are able to work in close proximity to startups, moving to Rio de Janeiro is not mandatory during the seed acceleration program. We strongly recommend though that at least part of the team should spend 4 months with us – and companies willing to do it may be prioritized in our selection – but we are able to set up virtual monitoring with some recurring meetings in person as well.
