Donâ€™t worry if your company was not selected in a previous acceleration cycle; it doesn&#8217;t prevent you from applying again in the future. We truly believe that startups that decide to apply again have an advantage over the others, because they had the opportunity to apply knowledge and acquire experience after the feedback loop from the previous cycle.
