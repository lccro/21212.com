Based on the structure of 21212.com, we offer the opportunity for accelerated startups to take full advantage of the seed acceleration program both in Brazil and in the USA. That means you will have access to both Brazilian and American mentors and investors, but you do not necessarily need to be physically accelerated in the US. This however is a possibility for cases where there is sinergy on both sides.
