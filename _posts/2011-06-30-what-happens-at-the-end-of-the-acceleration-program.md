After 4 months of acceleration, startups that have found successfully their market fit are invited to participate in the Investor’s Demo Day, in which entrepreneurs have an opportunity to pitch their projects to investors and VCs. Entrepreneurs will continue to have support from 21212.com when entering the 21212.com Alumni community, including investment negotiations resulting from the Investor’s Demo Day.
