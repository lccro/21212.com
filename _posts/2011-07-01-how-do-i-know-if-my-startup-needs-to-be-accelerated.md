The decision to submit an idea or startup to the 21212.com seed acceleration program depends mostly on market response. Your startup is certainly a great fit to be accelerated if it is based on an idea with great market potential or if it develops an innovative product that has not yet found effective response from the market. In either case, the accelerator will help you to find your market fit.
