We are physically located in Rio and NYC, but we are open to both Brazilian and foreign startups. We&#8217;re not really worried about your origin or the place where your company will be established after the seed acceleration program &#8211; our main rule is to create innovative businesses for the Brazilian market, as this is our expertise.
