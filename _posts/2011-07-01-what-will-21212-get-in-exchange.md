As part of the **21212.com** acceleration program, 21212 becomes your partner and receives passive equity in your company (the same kind as the founders have, i.e. Common Stock). The amount of equity in your company depends on your team and traction (users, revenue, etc.) in the market.

A portion of this equity goes to **21212.com** because we want to be co-founders of your new endeavor and have the same commitment you have to make it succeed, following the same &#8220;risk and reward&#8221; model. The other portion goes to **21212.com** Sponsors â€“ international and renowned VCs and angel and institutional investors. Many of these people will be mentors during the Program, and potential investors at 21212&#8217;s Demo Day.

This is our formula to grow significantly the chances of follow-on funding at the end of the Program.
