Queremos / WeDemand shares fan demand and data with artists and managers, granting them ownership of the communication channel and market insight derived from their users.

Queremos / WeDemand directly connects artists to the fans, enabling one-on-one conversation and provides the artist with the best places to tour, sell tickets and merchandise, promote new music or simply thank them for their support.

Unlike apps that just push out tour dates, Queremos / WeDemand gives power to the fans by allowing them to demand shows in their city. This creates a direct conversation between them and their favorite bands, thus amplifying engagement and improving the overall live event experience for both fans and artists.
