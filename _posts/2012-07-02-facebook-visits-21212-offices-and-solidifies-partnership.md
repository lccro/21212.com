This past Wednesday we had an awesome lecture by **Facebook Marketing Manager for Small Businesses in Latin America, Ricardo Vianna**. He visited the 21212 office to talk about the strategy behind advertising on Facebook.

**Facebook is also enthusiastically helping our startups**. Any startup accelerated by 21212 will receive advertising credit on Facebook as well as advice on the best strategies for taking advantage of the platform via the Start to Success program.

Ricardo commented, “Facebook supports the country’s entrepreneurs and has the tools and ideas to accelerate growth in these small and medium-sized business, connecting them with their audience in a targeted, and effective way.”

We’re excited to have Facebook on board with 21212!
