21212 initiated its first acceleration program in September 2011. In the following years, it played an important role in the development of the Brazilian digital ecosystem, with thousands of hours invested in hundreds of entrepreneurial activities around Brazil. More than 2,500 startups were assessed in its selection process and 42 of them participated in the acceleration program. The 6 accelerated classes included almost 200 entrepreneurs, who spent months working closely with the 21212 team and took their new experience and learning to hundreds of employees. Many of these companies have achieved excellent results, with cases of leadership in specific industries, internationalization, extensive fundraising and acquisitions.

In 2014, 21212 decided to invest in entrepreneurial education with the development of 21212 Academy &#8211; an online and free platform focused on empowering young entrepreneurs by providing access to all the knowledge and experience accumulated in its acceleration programs. In just nine months since its launch, text and video content from 21212 Academy impacted and connected more than 40,000 entrepreneurs in Brazil.

In 2015, after conducting its first major exit and write another success story in the Brazilian Internet history with the acquisition of ZeroPaper by Intuit (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/21/intuit-buys-zero-paper-its-first-acquisition-in-brazil/" target="_blank">read more about this story</a>), 21212 began to focus on active portfolio companies that currently are in a strategic position to grow rapidly and lead the consolidation of its markets in the short and medium term.
