21212 is the first startup accelerator operating in Brazil. Created by entrepreneurs with over 20 years of experience in the digital market (founders and / or members of companies like the Brazilian Movile, and the Americans Complex Media and Sling Media), its mission is to help entrepreneurs to create value in the growing Brazilian digital market.

Over the course of 4-6 months, 21212 works tirelessly to improve the entrepreneurs who joined its acceleration program, working with an exclusive team and mentors in areas such as business, product, technology, marketing and commercial, financial, fundraising, and legal. The goal is that companies get ready to grow organically and through partnerships and investments made by the extensive network of corporations and investors of 21212 network.

The Acceleration model is based on a long-term partnership. The accelerated companies give away a small portion of equity to 21212 at the beginning of the program, and can get ongoing support from 21212&#8217;s partners even after the acceleration program.
