**Rodolfo Ohl, SurveyMonkey&#8217;s Country Manager for Brazil**, visited the 21212 office last Wednesday to talk to our startups about **getting the most out of a survey and getting accurate feedback from potential customers**.

SurveyMonkey announced in April that they were opening operations in Brazil and is the first country to have its own dedicated manager. Rodolfo said in an interview in <a title="SurveyMonkey" href="http://pulsosocial.com/2012/06/11/rodolfo-ohl-surveymonkey-hopes-to-see-brazil-rise-to-number-5-by-2015/" target="_blank">Pulso Social</a>Â _&#8220;Brazilian people are very passionate for technology and innovations in this area, so building more awareness about SurveyMonkey is something that we are aiming to do&#8221;_.

Our startups will now receive credits for surveys they run during the Program. We&#8217;re excited to add another partner to our team and will keep pushing forward to provide the most to our startups!
